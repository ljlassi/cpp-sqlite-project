My first C++ program. Learning C++ OOP and SQLite. Also the first time I am using SQLite specifically.

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:

Opens SQLite database connection (creates the database if it does not exist), creates the table if it doesn't exist, runs an SQL INSERT query and closes the database connection.

Compile with g++ (don't forget to link sqlite3.h when compiling).

Further work is needed.
